# wikipedia_topic_modeling (Spark)

This is one of a few projects in which I used Spark to fetch and transform 20GB of wikipedia articles and then analyzed by a hand crafted topic model algorithm. 

The method can help you find similar article based on a certain article. And the similarity is calculated based on the text of the whole article. 

To view the process, you can look at the assn3_wiki.ipynb. It takes a few minutes to open because it contains lot of text output.
